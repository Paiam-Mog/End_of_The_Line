Dynamic Dialogue System:

Description: 
This system was built in to the previously implemented dialogue parsing/processing code. The system is a restructing of the previous code
that provided a tool for the writers to define and create flags in the game which remembers specific dialogue branches and choices the
player makes. Within the text, the writers can then check for the existence of these flags and if found, then additional dialogue choices
can be made to the player, entire sections of dialogue can be replaced and whole conversations become available to the player. This system
allows for the writers to design and create complex, branching dialogue trees and allow for the player's choices to alter the game state
as well.

Coding Features and Strategies Utilized in this system:
 - Data Structures such as sets to store the generated flags and lists to keep track of the changes made by the existence of a flag
 - String parsing and manipulation such as the ability to swap and replace sections of dialogue based on written checks for flags
