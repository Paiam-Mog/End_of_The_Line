# End_of_The_Line

# Game Description
End of the Line is a post-apocalyptic visual-novel game where you embark on a journey to follow the footsteps of your parents who disappeared years when they left your disease-striken village in order to find salvation at the rumored safe-haven known as the End of the Line. Along the way, you manage and recruit people to your crew as well as face various obstacles and challenges where you have to make important decision with mortal consequences.

# Role on the Project
I have been with the project for over a year now and am currently working as the Lead Software Engineer. As the lead engineer, I am responsible for implementing various new and complex systems into the game. My fellow engineers and I work together on solving various issues that we encounter in the game or we design the structure for new features. Additionally, I coordinate with designers, writers and artists to ensure that they are able to work with and utilize the tools and systems of the game.

# Implemented Systems and Features 
Some of the systems and features that I have worked on or implemented during my time include:
 * Rearchitecturing the dialogue system to provide the writers a tool to create dynamically altered 
   dialogue trees based on previous player choices
 * Background Character AI system that randomly selects and assigns character to move across the
   game space and randomly selected intervals, responding to the player's state and position.
 * Camera system that rotates the player view based on their progress on a path set by the designers, 
   used for a special transition sequence
 * Character spawner system that pulls an npc's prefab from an asset bundle and on start places their 
   character object into the game and assigns the appropriate references and values for the character
